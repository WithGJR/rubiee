# Rubiee

Rubiee is a programming language based on LLVM. Its syntax is very similar to Ruby, but surely Rubiee is not Ruby.

Rubiee has no `Class`, it's just a simple language with only the support of `function`, `variable` and `control flow construct`. 

## Current Progress

1. Simple arithmetic operators
2. Comparison operators 
3. Variable
4. Function call 
5. if construct
